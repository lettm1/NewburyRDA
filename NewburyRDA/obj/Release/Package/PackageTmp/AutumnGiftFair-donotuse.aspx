<p>The Newbury RDA Fair is a wonderful opportunity to make an early start with your Christmas shopping, enjoy a little retail therapy, have coffee or lunch with your friends in one of the beautiful restored barns at Hillfields Farm and support a very worthwhile charity.</p>
 
<p>Once again our stalls will have so much to offer from returning old favourites to new stalls holders 
<img src="img/fairtables.jpg" style="margin: 10px" width="200px" alt="Lesson1" align="left">    
    showing their collections for the first time (we replace at least 30% of our stalls each year). This year we will have at least 50 carefully selected stall holders offering a fantastic variety of well priced gifts, often not found on the High Street.  There will be presents and indulgencies, home accessories, luxury clothing for men and women, toys for all ages including the family pet and gourmet delicacies.</p>
 
<p>All proceeds go directly to Newbury RDA and we are very grateful to our stall holders, sponsors, advertisers, guests and volunteers as none of this would be possible without their help.</p>
 
<p>We look forward to seeing you.</p>
