                    <h3>2015</h3>
                    <p>1. On behalf of the children we would like to thank <strong>Over the Moon Foundation</strong> for their support through a generous donation which has enabled us to purchase new riding hats with a special adjustment system; new equipment for our gymkhana poles including targets, hooks and nets which are used in the children's riding sessions making them fun but also developing coordination and physical strength along with their social skills.  We have also purchased ASDAN workbooks for some of our children.  ASDAN is a curriculum supported programme designed to further children's development in numeracy and language in addition to helping social awareness, foster friendships and interaction between participants and building confidence and self esteem.</p>
                    <p>2. Special congratulations to <strong>Alice White</strong>, who lives locally and works in the racing industry.  Alice ran in the Hackney Half Marathon in May raising a brilliant £803 for Newbury RDA.  Many thanks to Alice and her sponsors.</p>
                    <p>3. Special thanks to our <strong>Autumn Fair Committee</strong> who worked incredibly hard over the year and during the event to raise a record breaking sum of over £10,000 at this year's Fair in September.  Thanks to Linda Benson, Linkie Whitehead, Carol Steljes, Carolyn Davies, Nicola Markham, Jo Stevenson-Hamilton, all those who ran and contributed to the hugely successful Cake Stall and to all those who helped out on the day doing a wide variety of jobs!</p>
