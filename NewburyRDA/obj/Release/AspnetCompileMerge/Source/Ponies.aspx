                    <p>We are looking for more ponies to join the team at our stables in Hampstead Norreys.  The ponies are looked after and cared for by our dedicated on site stable manager.</p>

                    <p>If you have a sound pony with a kind temperament, preferably a gelding, between 13.2 and 15 hands and 8 – 18 years old that might be suitable and is looking for a new home then please get in touch for a chat.</p>

                        I am sure the children tell you about the ponies they ride so let me tell you more about our special friends.

                        We depend on them, we couldn't operate without them and it is the ponies who the children love.  They do a magnificent job and I know bring great happiness and benefit to your children. 
                        

                        <strong>Bungle</strong>, an ex show pony, is on loan to us.  He is a very able pony, very obedient so brilliant for children to progress with their riding.  He does as the children ask and never takes advantage.  He has won lots of rosettes in the past and knows exactly what he has to do when he goes to Shows.

                        Next in size is <strong>Ollie</strong>.  Ollie has been lent to us by one of our volunteers and is a great asset.  He went to the Regional Show with two Mary Hare children who both came first in their class so have qualified for the RDA National Championships on the 19th July. This is the largest equine show for disabled competitors in the world.  Ollie prefers to be ridden by good riders who sit quietly and give him clear messages on what to do.  Elizabeth also lends us another of her ponies, Bramble when we need him.  We are very grateful to her.

                    <p>We have <strong>Many</strong>, another coloured horse who belongs to Cathy, our stable manager who lets us use him for our taller children. He is an ex-sports horse, and well trained.  He went to the National Championships last year and did very well.</p>
                    <p><strong>Arthur</strong> came the about the same time as Flossie.  He was a competition horse who had to retire because of an injury but he is great for us.  He is well schooled and very well behaved. He is a coloured horse with a black patch over one eye!</p>
