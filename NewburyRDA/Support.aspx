                                        <p>Although we are affiliated to Riding for the Disabled Association (our 'Trade Association’) we are a financially independent company providing therapy for disabled children.  In order to meet our costs, we rely entirely on the generous donations that are made to Newbury RDA and through Fundraising Events run by our Volunteers and other kind people. </p>

                                        <h2>2016</h2>
                                        <%--                            <p>In order to meet our costs, we rely entirely on the generous donations that are made to Newbury RDA and through Fundraising Events.  During the past year, we have raised about half of our costs through Fundraising and we are indebted to those Volunteers who gave up a considerable amount of their precious time to run each of the following events:  the <strong>Golf Competition</strong> in June, <strong>Truck Festival</strong> beverages stall in aid of Newbury RDA in July, the <strong>Autumn Fair in September (our main event)</strong>, the <strong>War Horse Presentation</strong> in November, the <strong>Canine First Aid Course</strong> also in November and the <strong>Wreath Making</strong> in December.</p>--%>

                                        <p>We would also like to thank Harrods (Thatcham), Mercedes-Benz (Newbury) and Vodafone whose staff volunteered with us making a fantastic difference to the general appearance of our dedicated centre at Hampstead Norreys;  and other smaller groups including pupils from Downe House School who continue to support us through donations and work parties.  Suzanne Kirkwood raised a significant sum undertaking a ‘sponsored’ trek in Nepal - the challenge of a lifetime. </p>

                                        <p>Huge thank you to all of our volunteers and supporters, particularly <strong>Merial Animal Heath</strong> who provide annual vaccinations for RDA ponies countrywide.</p>

                                        <p><strong>The Trustees would like to thank the following for their generous donations.</strong></p>
