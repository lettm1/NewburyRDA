                            <p>We are currently running 10 classes split between 4 schools on a weekly basis.  In addition, there is a Sunday lesson and a couple of private lessons.</p>

                            <p>We have had a busy and eventful year.</p>

                            <p>•	24 August  2015 - we had our fabulously successful Autumn Fair, raising over £12,000 - an amazing achievement.  Huge thanks go to the Fair Committee and, to Carol and Nigel Steljes for so generously hosting the event again.</p>
                            <p>•	October – the Thursday class held a successful Bridge drive, hosted by Ursula Codrington.</p>
                            <p>•	21 April, 2016 Hillfields Farm hosted the Lighting of a Beacon for the Queens 90th Birthday celebrations.  Carol Steljes kindly donated half the proceeds from the evening to Newbury RDA. </p>
                            <p>•	May 2016 - the Monday morning class riders competed in the Fancy Dress competition at Windsor Horse Show coming second, a marvellous result which was a well deserved reward for all those involved</p>
                            <p>•	June 2016 - Aaron, Emily, Jodee and Zack competed at the Regionals at Wellington. Congratulations to Ursula and Amanda who took Jodee (our first unsighted rider) who carried out an excellent dressage test on Flossie achieving a very high score.  Aaron qualified on Murphy for the National Championships at Hartpury in the Countryside Challenge.  George (highly commended), Zack and Emily all did well in their entries.  Congratulations to everyone involved in the riders’ training, and to Cathy, for a massive team effort.</p>
